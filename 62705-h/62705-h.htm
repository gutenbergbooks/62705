<p class="smaller hanging">ENTERED ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS in the year 1859
by <span class="smcap">Benjamin H. Day</span>, in the Clerk’s Office of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Within the past few years, numerous physiological
books have been compiled and printed, ostensibly for popular
reading and to impart certain information which could
not be obtained except from very expensive medical works.
On examination, nearly the whole of them prove to be the
productions of persons calling themselves physicians, and
issued as a medium of advertising their medicines, or their
peculiar practice. In most of these books, facts in physiology
are so mixed up with empirical self-laudations, absurd reasonings,
useless repetitions, and fabulous cases in point, as
to become not only intensely tedious, but in a measure disgusting
to the reader.</p>

<p>The Prevention of Conception appears to be one of the
main features of these publications, and each author professes
to have a secret plan of his own for that purpose,
which he offers to impart for a professional fee of five dollars.
An offer like this to intelligent people is understood
as arrant quackery; but there are such a vast number of
married persons who desire to limit the number of their
offspring, that many will send their money in sheer desperation,
and with little or no hope of success.</p>

<p>As the writer of this treatise does not propose to offer
his professional services to his readers, and as even the
copy-right of it is disposed of in advance, he will endeavor
to present, briefly and impartially, the prominent facts
which modern science has demonstrated in the phenomena
of procreation, the conception and production of offspring,
and the various safe and harmless methods that may be
resorted to by married people to prevent child-bearing.
All that is known on these interesting and important subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
is given in plain language, and with but few medical
terms. In collecting this information, the writer has examined
all the different modes ever recommended, discovered
or invented, for the prevention of conception, whether
alleged to be secret or otherwise. Some of them were
found to be utterly worthless; others may, in most cases,
be employed successfully by extreme caution and pains-taking,
while not more than two or three are perfectly reliable.
These last are subject to failure, only from prejudice
or want of energy; and if adopted with moderate caution,
will be successful. In these discoveries the French physicians
appear to be the most ingenious, and some of the
plans given are consequently of French origin.</p>

<p>The Physiology of Generation, which comprises all medical
knowledge relative to the reproduction of offspring, is
a subject of intense interest to the adult portion of mankind.
It has been zealously investigated by learned men
of all ages—physicians, philosophers and theologians—and
numerous conflicting theories have been advanced,
books written, and ideas inculcated, which have presented
the subject in various phases for popular reading. One
class denounces all attempts to prevent conception and
child-bearing as immoral, unnatural, and hurtful to health,
while others hold more liberal views, and consider that
married people have a perfect right to decide for themselves
whether they shall breed a family or not. The
writer takes no part in these arguments. He is content to
impart to his readers, in a brief and matter-of-fact form,
reliable physiological information which could only be obtained
by long study from other sources. With this explanation,
he trusts that the object of his little treatise
will be appreciated by the public.</p>

<h1>THE BOOK OF NATURE.</h1>

<h2 id="MALE_GENERATIVE_ORGANS">MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS.</h2>

<p>The Generative Organs of man consists of two distinct
outward members, called the Penis and the Testes, or
Testicles—both together being frequently called the Genitals.
The Testes are inclosed in a sac or bag hanging from
the pubic bone called the Scrotum, and their functions are
to produce the male principle or Semen, as the Ovaries in
the female ripen the Ovum or Egg. The Testes are a
curious work of Nature. On dissection they are found to
be composed of fine blood vessels intermingled with small
tubes called the Seminal Tubes, in which the Semen is
generated. Some very knowing physicians say that there
are sixty thousand of these Seminal Tubes; but we doubt
if anybody ever counted them. These tubes, as they leave
the Testes, gradually join together until finally a single
tube only goes from each Testicle. These are called the
Vas Deferens, and they ascend to the abdomen through a
larger tube, (which also contains arteries, nerves, lymphatics,
&amp;c.,) where they connect with two small organs called
Seminal Vesicles. From these vesicles the Semen passes
downwards through a tube called the Ejaculatory Canal,
which is connected with the Prostate Gland, and from
whence it is forced to the Urethra or urinal passage, and
so out of the body. This is a brief outline of all the organs
connected with the generative system of man: the
Testes have the peculiar property of making the Semen—the
Vas Deferens and the Ejaculatory Canal carry it into
the abdomen to the Prostate Gland, from whence it is conveyed,
by a peculiar but spasmodic effort, through the urinal
passage in the Penis into the body of the female. It
is supposed that the Seminal Vesicles and Prostate Gland
impart a vital principle to the Semen, and that the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pleasurable feeling experienced during connection with the
female springs from these organs.</p>

<p>The Scrotum, in a healthy state, is contracted so as to
draw its skin into folds and keep the Testes close to the
body. But when a person is in ill health, or greatly fatigued,
the skin relaxes and the two Testes hang low, the
Scrotum being then supported in the middle by a membrane
or cord called the Septum Scroti, which acts as a
sort of partition. The Scrotum of old men is permanently
relaxed in this manner; but in children it is a sure indication
of ill health.</p>

<p>The size of the Testes vary in different persons. The
average of mankind have them each about the bigness of
a pigeon’s egg; but sometimes they are larger. It seldom
makes any difference in the actual power of procreation
whether these organs are large or small, though persons
with large Testes can generally perform the act of copulation
oftener, and with less exhaustion. A man with large
Testes generally has a large Penis, as the size of the one
usually governs the growth of the other; but it is by no
means certain that sexual connection thereby affords him
any more pleasure. Such men should marry with great
caution. Many females are incapable of affording them
pleasure from the comparative smallness of their private
parts; and they suffer much pain and ill health from such
intercourse. On the contrary, men whose genital organs
are not fully developed, though they may impregnate, yet
they cannot always give full satisfaction to the female. If
it could so be that people about to marry were properly
matched in their private parts, it would prevent a great
deal of unhappiness in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Some curious cases are reported in the books of ill-matched
couples in this respect. One of the Princes of
the Royal Family of England (a son of George III.) died
without legitimate issue because he could not have connection
with his wife—she being too small, or he being too
large for the purpose. It is true, he was entitled to a divorce
by law, but it was said he respected his wife too
much to resort to such a measure. Another curious case
was that of Baron Brunner, whose wife claimed a divorce
on the ground that her husband was a sort of eunuch, who
could afford her no pleasure during connection. But in
this case, as Madame was the mother of a daughter, to
whom she dared not deny the paternity of the Baron, her
petition was rejected.</p>

<p>The Penis is the principal generative organ of man. It
is usually from five to seven inches in length, hanging pendant,
and extending from the Pelvic Bones to the glans at
the end, and is divided into two parts called the Cavernosum
and the Spongiosum. There is a groove underneath
and between these two parts, through which runs the
Urethra, or urinal passage. The head of the Penis is called
the Bulb, and is of a spongy nature, being filled with little
cells or cavities communicating with each other, and which
extend into blood vessels which run the whole length of
the organ, and are finally connected with an artery and a
vein in the body. When no excitement of the part exists,
these cells and blood vessels are nearly empty; but when
excited by sexual desires, they rapidly fill with blood, when
the Penis stands erect and enlarges to one-third greater
size. The erection is also assisted by a number of muscles
which only act when the blood rushes into the part. These
are called the Cavernosus Muscles. In some persons the
erection is very sudden, while in others it is the reverse—all
depending upon the temperament and construction of
the parts. The time for the erection to subside is also different
in different persons. The causes of this difference
depend upon certain vital actions of the blood vessels not
fully understood. In old age this organ will often become
hard and erect, though it requires more time, and the erection
subsides almost instantly after connection with a female.
The Penis is often destroyed by accident or by disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and sometimes it is naturally deformed. A case is
stated by Dr. Hollick of a young man 19 years old, whose
Penis was only a quarter of an inch long! By a protracted
and careful course of treatment, however, it was made to
grow several inches. Some male children have been born
with no Penis at all—a slight swelling, like the top of a
small tumor, being the only mark of the spot where it
ought to have grown. In some cases of deformity like
this, men have been known to beget children, the flow of
Semen being ample; and it only requiring, for the purpose
of impregnation, that the Semen shall be placed within
the external lips of the private parts of the female, as will
be shown hereafter.</p>

<p>There are frequent malformations of the Penis. Sometimes
it will grow in such a way that, when erect, it turns
one side or the other, so that association is painful and
very difficult. This is generally caused by contraction of
the skin or muscles, and is very easily remedied by carefully
cutting them in the proper place. Sometimes a one-sided
Penis is the result of aneurism, swelling of the veins,
or unnatural erections. These causes generally form tumors,
which must first be reduced before a proper action
can be restored. Cold astringent lotions, used constantly,
will generally cure these tumors, though it is sometimes
necessary to bind some smooth, hard substance firmly on
to them—a piece of horn or ivory being the most suitable.
Frequently the cord at the end of the Penis, which binds
the prepuce, will be so short as to pull down the end of
the Glans and thus prevent a proper connection with the
female. This cord, when too short, will often break; but
the best way is to cut it carefully either with a sharp knife
or a pair of scissors. A Penis with a head too large is a
malformation caused by boyish pranks in handling the
organ during its growth.</p>

<p>The causes of a non-development of the Penis are various.
Sometimes a general torpor of the Testes retards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
its growth. Disease or excess will frequently make it
wither and decrease in size; and many a youth by early
masturbation prevents the full development of the organ.
Injuries to the Testes, during early childhood, will often
stop the growth of the Penis. The Mumps, Scarlet Fever,
Measles, Rickets, and Scrofula—each of these diseases will
also more or less affect its perfect development. It is
nearly impossible to prescribe a remedy for this evil, as
much depends upon the temperament of the person affected.
In persons of little sexual feeling, I would recommend
a rational and moderate use of the organ as Nature
intended. The healthy excitement thus produced will tend
to its growth. In some men, however, this plan would
rather do harm than good—a frequent tepid bath, with
brisk rubbing of the muscles, being the proper treatment.
A stimulating ointment of some kind might be used to advantage
with this latter treatment. A tube to fit over the
Penis, with an air-pump, is frequently used by physicians
in connection with a shampooing of the muscles, and in
some cases this acts beautifully.</p>

<p>The lascivious practices of boys, who learn of one another
the habit of onanism—their too early connection with
females—these and other habits affect the growth and full
development of the Penis.</p>

<p>The Penis should be fully developed in a boy fourteen
or fifteen years old. At that age the seminal fluid, destined
for the perpetuation of the species, begins to be
secreted by the Testicles, and not only excites the sexual
organs, but affects every part of the body. The power of
the mind, too, is improved; the digestion becomes more
vigorous; the circulation of the blood is more rapid; indeed,
every organ is abundantly nourished by it, and they
perform their functions with much more energy than before
this period of life. But the sexual organs, notwithstanding
they may be of full size, have not yet matured, as
will be shown hereafter.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SEMEN">THE SEMEN.</h2>

<p>The Semen is a yellowish-white liquid substance secreted
in the Testes of the Male, and which contains the animalculæ
that grow to be future human beings. A microscopic
examination shows it to consist of two substances, one
fluid and the other little white globules. These globules
soon dissolve when exposed to the air. The composition
of the Semen is nine-tenths water—the remaining tenth
being 10 soda, 30 phosphate of lime, and 60 animal mucilage
containing a peculiar principle which is unknown.
The living animalculæ of the Semen can be plainly seen
with a microscope. They look like little eels with large
heads, or pollywogs, and are supposed to be the germ of
the brain and spine. They are called Zoospermes, and the
microscope enables us to study their habits, and describe
them with correctness. These animalculæ first grow in the
little globules or eggs. Their extreme smallness may be
imagined when we state that one of these globules, which
are not visible to the naked eye, but can be seen only with
a microscope, contains thirty of them. After the globules
break open, the Zoospermes grow and become developed
before they are in a fit state to enter the female Ovum.
Attached to their head is a sort of sucker which fastens
itself on to anything it can take hold of. By the aid of
the microscope we are enabled to study the habits of these
animalculæ so closely that it is known they cast their skins
as they grow larger, like some insects. A French physiologist
writes that he easily distinguishes their sex, male
and female, but we doubt the truth of his assertion. They
are apparently very playful and active, but it appears to be
their nature to move only in one direction, and that straight
forward—which movement has a connection with impregnation
that is explained elsewhere in these pages. In
watching the motions of these curious little creatures, we
find that combats frequently occur among them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
fight very fiercely, and sometimes the fight lasts until only
one or two out of a dozen or more are left alive, showing
a pugnacity of disposition peculiar to mankind in the primitive
or half-civilized state. They will live for several
hours in warm water, and it is thus that their manœuvres
are more easily seen. The Semen of a boy, before puberty,
contains no Zoospermes; and hence females of amorous
propensities have indulged with them without becoming
impregnated. Diseases of a certain character, and also
some kinds of drugs, will destroy the vitality of the Semen.</p>

<p class="caption-list">5. Zoospermes darting in to impregnate the Ovum.</p>

</div>

<p>The animalculæ of the Semen are not developed in the
Testes. While there, it contains only the granules, which
ripen as they proceed, and it is not until they reach the
Prostate Gland that they burst open. It is therefore necessary
to a healthy connection, that some time should elapse
between the acts of coition. It frequently happens, when
people first marry, that months will pass before impregnation
takes place. This is because of too frequent connection.
The Semen does not have time to be fully developed
on its passage from the Testes.</p>

<p>We have stated that it is a habit of the Zoospermes to
move only in one direction, and that straight forward. It
is this peculiarity which enables them to make their way
up into the Womb, even from the Labia or external lips
of the female. It is found, also, that Zoospermes will live
twenty-four hours in the private parts of the female, during
which time she may become impregnated by them. It
seems to be of little consequence <i>how</i> Semen is deposited
in the female organ. Conception may take place, even
without sexual connection, if the Semen is fresh from the
male, and healthy. The sexual feeling of the female, though
it may conduce certain favorable conditions of the part, and
thus promote the result, is not, in most cases, necessary.</p>

<p>The celebrated John Hunter reported the case of a patient
of his who had entirely lost his penis by syphilis. It
was sloughed off half an inch into his body. Yet this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
could eject his semen from the orifice; and he married after
his misfortune, and became the father of a child. His
wife was impregnated by means of a small glass syringe,
with which the semen was injected into the proper place.</p>

<p>The Parisian doctors make preparations of various drugs
to destroy the animalculæ of the Semen, and thus prevent
conception. This plan, if thoroughly adopted, produces
the desired effect, as will be shown hereafter. Iodine,
Strychnine, Prussic Acid, or even Opium, will instantly
kill the Zoospermes. Alcohol will likewise generally destroy
them, or render them powerless until they die. An
electric shock kills them instantly, and so will cold water,
in very many cases, though not always.</p>

<p>Modern science enables us to speak with certainty relative
to a cause of childless couples, which is a want of vitality
of the Semen. Formerly it was supposed that barrenness
was a peculiarity of women alone; but it is now
known that the fault is more frequently in the husband.
The Semen of these barren men contains the usual globules,
which never ripen or come to maturity. Such men
may experience a certain degree of pleasure in connection,
but they cannot become fathers. The Semen is undeveloped,
like that of a boy of ten years. The sexual desires
of such men are never very strong, and quickly subside;
nor can they excite the female to any great degree of ardor.
Long continued excesses in venery, whether with women
or by means of onanism, is a frequent cause of barrenness
or impotence in men. In these cases the Semen loses its
prolific power. Frequently this impotence cannot be remedied,
though I have cured many persons of it who had
daily involuntary emissions of the spermatic fluid without
erections or amorous impulse. The treatment consists in
avoiding its causes, restoring the general health by proper
diet and exercise, and in invigorating the affected organs
by the internal and external use of such remedies as have
a direct influence upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_OVARIES">THE OVARIES.</h2>

<p>The Ovaries, or egg-vessels of a human female, are two
bodies situated on each side of the Pelvis just within the
lower edge of the hip bone. They vary in size, averaging
about the same as the male testicle, but of a different shape,
being flat and oblong, like an almond. When in a healthy
state, they are of pale red color, and have a rough exterior.
Every Ovary consists of a large number of cells
about the size of a buck-shot, called the Graafian Vesicles,
and which contain a transparent fluid. On looking at this
fluid with a glass, the Ovum, or germ of the human being,
can be plainly seen in each cell. It is very small—not
much larger than a grain of sand. A healthy and perfectly
formed female has some thirty or more of these vesicles.
It is impossible to tell the exact number, because all of
them are not fully developed at the same time. In fact,
they ripen and become perfect in succession, from month to
month, and one is expelled at each menstrual flow, as described
below, beginning at the age of puberty, and so continuing
until the turn of life, when all have been expelled
and the Ovaries then become barren. The Ovum generally
comes from each side alternately—the right ovary expelling
its egg one month, and the left the next, and so on. But
where disease or any cause has disabled one Ovary, the
other one, if healthy, expels its egg monthly. Such are
the curious workings of Nature.</p>

<p>When an Ovum, or egg, is fully developed, it leaves the
Ovary, and passing through a very curious hollow ligature
called the Fallopian Tube, is thus conveyed into the Womb.
This occurs once in four weeks in a healthy female. In
order to detach this ripe egg from the Ovary, real inflammation
is experienced, which causes a discharge of blood
and mucus, called the menstrual or monthly flow. This
constant action of the Ovaries has a most extraordinary
influence upon the whole being of woman. It not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
absorbs a large portion of her nervous power, but it actually
affects her mind to a considerable extent. It is the
principal cause of hysteria, fickleness, gayety, peevishness,
and other eccentricities peculiar to female character.</p>

<p>The Ovum usually reaches the Womb from one to two
days after the monthly flow ceases. After being retained
a certain time by a thin membrane called the Decidua, the
membrane loosens and passes out of the body, taking the
Ovum along with it. While it remains in the Womb, it is
of course liable to be impregnated by the semen from the
male; but the moment it is expelled, no impregnation can
take place until another monthly flow. Many French females,
who have studied this subject closely and attentively,
are enabled to tell with certainty when the Ovum leaves
them, and they avoid contact with the other sex except
during the interval between its expulsion and their next
monthly turn. In this way they avoid child-bearing.</p>

<p>The usual healthy time during which the Ovum remains
in the Womb, is fourteen days. In some females it remains
as long as sixteen or seventeen days. Cases of supposed
barrenness are frequently those where the ova are expelled
from the womb very soon after lodging there. It is then
necessary for the husband, if he desires children, to cohabit
with his wife immediately after the menstrual flow ceases.
On the contrary, those who would avoid having offspring,
(unless they use the means pointed out in another part of
this book,) should refrain from sexual indulgence until the
Ovum has been expelled, which is generally the third week
after the menstrual flow has ceased.</p>

<p>By a curious provision of Nature, the blood and vital
energy required to ripen and expel the monthly Ovum in
a female, is turned in another channel during pregnancy,
and tends to secrete the milk and the fluids on which the
growing fœtus subsists. Thus the ova lie dormant during
that period, and they seldom begin to ripen again until the
new-born infant is weaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be understood, from the foregoing facts, that no
female can produce more than a certain number of ova.
When all are exhausted, the turn of life takes place. It is,
therefore, desirable that girls should not become sexually
excited before the full age of puberty, as such excitement
is sure to hasten that period. The sooner they begin to
menstruate, the sooner they become old women. In the
same way maiden ladies usually reach the turn of life
sooner than child-bearing women.</p>

<p>In some women, the Ovaries being originally weak, or
diseased, they are irregular in their menstrual periods, or
have frequent flooding from the debilitated state of the
organs. Deformity of children is supposed to arise from
imperfect ova, and want of sufficient vital force to fully develop
them. The ripening of the Ovum, or egg, is in many
respects like unto the ripening of an apple on the tree.
Some are perfect and beautiful, while others are deformed
and ungainly in appearance.</p>

<p>The two Fallopian Tubes, which connect the ovaries
with the Womb, are very curious. They are hollow ligaments,
a little larger at one end than the other. On dissection
they are found to be lined with fine thread-like
points, which point towards the smallest end of the tube,
adjoining the Womb. These points are in perpetual motion,
like small worms, and this operation is what causes
the egg to pass through the tube. For the same reason
nothing can go back in these tubes from the Womb to the
Ovaries. These tubes also afford a passage for the secretions
and fluids, which would otherwise accumulate in the
Ovaries of women in ill health. A considerable portion
of the discharges from the Vagina, to which some females
are subject, come from the Ovaries through the Fallopian
Tubes into the Womb, and thence to the lower passage.
Sexual or amative feeling on the part of the female affects
these tubes, by causing them to straighten and relax, thus
working the points on the inner surface, and hastening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
passage of the Ovum, should one be in the passage. This
feeling also hastens the ripening of the Ovum, to a certain
extent. The usual length of the Fallopian Tubes is from
three to four inches. A woman may be made perfectly
barren by tying ligatures round these two tubes, an operation
which would be attended with but little pain. It is
obvious, however, that her health might seriously suffer in
consequence. In France, animals are frequently served in
this manner in preference to the painful process of spaying.</p>

<p>The Uterus, or Womb, is suspended mid-way between
the lower edges of the hip-bones. Its upper part goes up
between the bladder and the rectum, and lies upon the
bladder. Its lower part joins the passage called the Vagina,
which is usually about four or live inches in length.
In fact, the neck of the Womb hangs down into the Vagina,
and is the cause of an indescribable delightful feeling
on the part of the female when in connection with the
male. Many women say that they experience very little
sexual feeling, and that the act of copulation is to them a
matter of indifference. This is because the mouth of the
Womb is not reached or touched by the glans of the male
organ; and the pleasurable sensation of the female is then
confined to a slight irritation of the Clitoris and Nymphæ,
in the private parts. When the amorous sensations of the
female are excited during connection, the Womb becomes
engorged with blood, and moves up and down in the Vagina,
bringing the neck in contact with the glans of the
male organ, and this contact, if not too violent, is the perfection
of sexual indulgence for both parties.</p>

<p>The Vagina is a curved passage from the Womb to the
lower private parts of the female called the Vulva. It is
a tubular passage, the diameter of which varies from one
and a half to two inches, and is usually from four to five
inches in length. This curved tube possesses some curious
powers, which are in action only during connection with
the male. It is lined with a mucus membrane throughout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and underneath is thick cellular membrane which is spongy
and fills with blood during sexual excitement, the same as
the head of the penis in the male. This is the erectile tissue.
On each side are certain little openings where are
secreted a thickish gray fluid of a peculiar smell, which is
discharged copiously during connection. Some uninformed
persons erroneously think this to be a kind of Semen; but
it is merely a fluid provided by Nature to assist in the nuptial
act. Some females have the erectile tissue imperfectly
developed, and for this reason are liable to a lax-vagina,
which leads to a falling of the Womb, and other diseases
that render the marriage state necessary to restore them to
health. Mothers are apt to attach too little importance to
this disease.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Vagina, a small oval opening, easily
seen by parting the lips of the private parts, is usually
closed in virgins by a thin membrane, or skin, which grows
over it. This is called the Hymen; and in ancient times
its presence was considered necessary at marriage to establish
the virginity of the bride. If in reality such proof
was demanded, we think that very many brides must have
been pronounced lewd, for there is scarcely one woman in
a hundred at the present day who preserves her Hymen
intact until she is twenty years old. In some, it is broken
at the first menstrual flow—in others, any debilitating disease
of the parts destroys it—and many girls who constantly
bathe and wash their private parts, unconsciously
wash away this membrane. These are cases where it is
very thin; but where it has strength to resist such accidents,
it may even then be quickly destroyed by any attempt
of the female to produce sexual excitement. Some
curious facts are related in the medical books of the toughness
of the Hymen in certain cases. Dr. Wakley, of London,
was applied to by a woman who alleged that though
her husband regularly performed his marital duties, yet she
herself could not enjoy the nuptial act. On examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
it was found that the Hymen had not been broken, though
the woman had been married eight years. The membrane
was a tough, calloused substance, and it was deemed necessary
to cut it out entirely. This lady became a mother in
less than eleven months from the time of the operation.
Dr. Bostwick, of New York, had a case where a thick
piece of flesh grew over the mouth of the Vagina; and
though the woman had the menstrual flow regularly
through a small opening, yet her husband could have no
sexual pleasure with her. A very painful and dangerous
operation relieved this lady, and she is now the mother of
a family. As a general rule, a girl loses her Hymen before
she is twenty, and it is seldom that she knows when it is
destroyed.</p>

<p>In some women the mouth of the Vagina is so small
that a first connection is painful, tearing the part and
causing a flow of blood. When such women become
widows, or refrain from sexual intercourse for a long period,
the same tearing and flow of blood may again occur
on resuming connection.</p>

<p>The external appearance of the private parts of a female,
as given in the engraving, we will here particularize. The
peculiar round and plump prominence at the lower extremity
of the abdomen, is a thick layer of fatty matter
over the pubic bone, called the Mons Veneris. This is
usually covered with hair at the age of puberty. In some
cases the hair grows very profusely, and to the length of
six or eight inches. Others have but little hair, and some
none at all. The growth of hair is usually considered the
sign of womanhood, though it is really no proof of that
condition. Many girls have a growth of hair over the
Mons at the age of ten or eleven years, while the menstrual
flow will not commence until some years after. The two
outer lips of the part are also covered with hair. These
are called Labia, and inside they have little glans or follicles
which discharge a mucus of a peculiar smell, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
provided by Nature to keep the parts in health. Within
these external lips or Labia, are smaller ones called the
Nymphæ. In infants the Nymphæ can be plainly seen
outside, as the Labia do not cover them; but as the child
grows, the external lips gradually close, and in a perfectly-formed
female, at the age of puberty, nothing can be seen
but the outer lips, which are, or should be, hidden by the
hair.</p>

<p>At the upper junction of the Nymphæ is the Clitoris, a
very curious formation which resembles a miniature male
penis. This is an organ which, when irritated, causes sexual
desires. It is usually about the size of a pea, though
in some cases it is larger. The growth of the Clitoris to
an unnatural size is what has given rise to a belief in the
existence of hermaphrodites, or persons of double sex. I
can easily understand how these reports originated. A female
infant with a Clitoris of a very large size would naturally
induce such a belief by persons ignorant of physiology—for
the Clitoris is always proportionably a great
deal larger before puberty—and particularly so when the
child is first born. In an unnatural growth, then, of this
member, the private parts of an infant would certainly
present a hermaphroditic appearance. It is almost unnecessary
to say that no such human beings ever existed as
hermaphrodites. Those that have been so called were females
with an enlarged Clitoris. This enlargement being
a source of some mortification to the girl as she grows to
womanhood, it should be partially amputated, an operation
which can be performed with perfect safety. Young girls
of amorous desires get up a sexual excitement, and produce
masturbation, by rubbing the Clitoris; and in boarding
schools they often practice the habit upon one another
until they cause repeated Orgasms, and in this manner injure
their health. Many of the diseases of after life may
be traced to such unnatural pranks—particularly the weakness
which causes miscarriage and excessive flooding.</p>

<h2 id="PHILOSOPHY_OF_SEXUAL_DESIRES">PHILOSOPHY OF SEXUAL DESIRES.</h2>

<p>The sexual organs of man and woman are wonderfully
adapted to each other, and have a perfect power of mutual
attraction. Nature sacrifices every thing to reproduction:
it is thus that we enjoy all strength, vigor and beauty, so
as to excite us to contribute to the procreation of our species;
and thus that such exquisite pleasure is associated
with the copulative act. It is for this reason also that we
experience so many sweet illusions in the brilliant season
of our amours, and that we give way to others when our
reproductive powers have failed. In a word, Nature always
regards the species, and never the individual; and whatever
we may say or think of our superiority over inferior animals,
we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that, like
the brutes, we are influenced in our unions by the pleasure
of sexual intercourse. It is useless to deny that the majority
of marriages which are apparently based on the sentiment
called love, are nothing more than the result of an
involuntary obedience to the imperious voice of our sexual
organs. A man admires the graceful figure, the voluptuous
form, and the general female graces of a woman, and he at
once desires to possess her person. This induces him to
cultivate her acquaintance, and unless he finds something
in her disposition positively disagreeable, ten to one he will
offer her marriage. Who will deny that sexual desire was
the moving cause of this connection? A woman meets a
man of fine figure, noble gait and manner, broad chest,
and elevated head, furnished with a luxuriant growth of
hair. His eyes are full of fire, and he is amiable, gallant
and polite. She at once feels a thrilling desire to become
better acquainted with him. What is that but a sexual
yearning? Thus far, certainly, no sentimental collusion
can have occurred between them.</p>

<p>The philosophy of sexual desires has been frequently discussed
by learned men, and interesting experiments have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
been made to test whether the attraction of the two sexes
was not precisely the same in human beings as in the minor
animals. These tests proved that our animal natures are
not directed altogether by the intellect. We see young
persons of opposite sex mutually caress and embrace each
other by some mysterious influence, even before they are
of sufficient age to experience sexual desires. This mutual
attraction is attributed by some people to Animal Magnetism—the
male being the positive, and the female the negative
principle. We, however, believe it to be an instinctive
sympathy; for experiments have been made which prove
that the Generative Organs of either sex exercise a certain
mysterious influence one upon the other. A French physiological
writer says that two vigorous young persons were
put in a semi-insensible state by the use of certain drugs.
Being stripped and their private parts placed slightly in
contact, (their heads being fully covered,) this slight touch
instantly excited the sexual feeling. This experiment is
reported in detail, and we do not doubt that it was <i>bona-fide</i>.
The peculiar instinctive attraction in this case was
so delicate that it acted almost like electricity to the male
organ. Besides this instinctive attraction, the nervous sensibility
is so constituted as to aid in the union of the sexes.
In the present state of society, however, young people do
not usually wait the slow process of Nature’s teachings,
but gain their knowledge by a precocious association or
under the instruction of their seniors. The sexual impulse,
under such circumstances, is forced and unnatural, and is
frequently the parent of incurable disease.</p>

<p>Coition, or sexual union, may be compared to a fit of
epilepsy, or to an electrical shock. It entirely engages
both the mind and the body; we neither hear nor see, but
the soul is entirely absorbed in the act. When a man is
performing this act, if his thoughts wander, the product
will be feeble, and if his wife become pregnant the offspring
will be inferior. This fact is applied to the offspring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of great geniuses, who are supposed to be thinking of
something else when they beget their children, and hence
their descendants are often much below them in intellect.
In further confirmation of this theory, history informs us
that some of the greatest men the world ever saw were
bastards—children begotten with vigor, and when the
minds of the parents are supposed to have been absorbed
in the one idea of a loving sexual embrace. Aristotle believed
that the causes of deformed children, of monstrosities,
and of all defective offspring, were in consequence of
imperfect connections, or acts of generation when the
minds of the parents were depressed by passion, anxiety,
trouble, or any difficult or abstract matters.</p>

<p>Persons of moderate and regular habits, with strong and
sound constitutions, beget healthful infants; while those
whose habits are excessively mental, generally produce
feeble offspring, though their constitutions and general
health may be good.</p>

<p>Another cause of feeble children is the abuse of the function
of generation by too frequent intercourse. In such
cases the semen is thin and watery, being too suddenly
secreted. Harvey says that to produce vigorous offspring,
the spermatic fluid ought to remain two or three days in
its receptacles for its thinner parts to become absorbed,
when more vitality will be imparted to it, and hence the
more vigorous will be the offspring.</p>

<p>It will be thus seen that the proper union of the sexes
is at that moment when the mind and body are at rest,
and when both parties are in a mood for mutual caresses.
Certain moral and intellectual perceptions undoubtedly
govern their feelings under such circumstances, and aid in
producing that intense pleasurable feeling which a healthy
and proper connection will always promote.</p>

<p>As to the times when sexual union should be avoided, I
would say that during five or six days after the monthly
turn of the female commences, it is absolutely unhealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to both. Married men of cleanly habits will religiously
observe the Jewish law in this respect, and wait seven
days. It was formerly thought that connection with a female
during the menstrual flow, was the origin of a certain
sexual disease called gonorrhœa; but such is not the
fact. Connection during that period is, however, unnatural,
hurtful, and often painful to the female. Neither
should there be any intimacy of this kind when the female
is troubled with fluor albus, or whites, as then there is danger
that the male may contract gonorrhœa. When a girl
appoints her wedding day, she should reckon as near as
possible a time when she will be fully over her monthly
turn. If subject to fluor albus, she should first seek the
most efficient means of cure; and if possible, a cure should
be effected before she marries. Girls subject to this complaint
seldom enjoy the constant sexual intercourse incident
to married life. Medical science can manage this disease
so easily and effectually by the aid of the Truss, or
Abdominal Supporter, that there is no excuse for neglecting
it. Unless the strictest cleanliness is practiced by the
wife while she has the whites, she may give her husband
the disease called gonorrhœa. She should never have any
connection with him in the morning until she has risen
and washed the part thoroughly. Suspicious men have
often believed their wives unfaithful because they have
contracted gonorrhœa from the whites. But the fact is
well known to medical men that that alone is the original
cause of the disease.</p>

<p>In Persia, and indeed in most Mahomedan countries
where a plurality of wives is allowed, it is considered indecent
to approach a woman for sexual intercourse during
pregnancy, or when she is suckling her child. This custom
is highly commendable, and if observed among Christians
it would tend to promote the health of both the mother
and her offspring, for Nature never intended that the
nuptial act should be performed solely for the gratification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of our passions. Nevertheless, I do not say that a moderate
indulgence during pregnancy would be hurtful to a robust
woman; though to a weak and nervous one it surely is.
But after the child is born, sexual intercourse should cease
until it is weaned, to insure its health. Many sucking children
die in consequence of the sexual indulgences of their
parents, and none are wholly unaffected thereby.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="TIME_AND_MANNER_OF_IMPREGNATION">TIME AND MANNER OF IMPREGNATION.</h2>

<p>We have stated elsewhere that there are certain times
during the month when it is impossible for a woman to be
impregnated by sexual connection. This is a fact that may
be relied upon with the utmost certainty, and we will discuss
it more in detail. The Vesicles of the Ovary are constantly
growing and ripening, as we have shown. Once in
four weeks one or more of them is ready to leave its cell.
Inflammation commences—which is called the Menstrual
Flow—the Vesicle then begins to enlarge, and by the time
the flow ceases, it bursts open, when the Ovum or Egg
within escapes and is taken up by some very curious little
membranes and drawn into the Fallopian Tube. It passes
through this tube into the Womb, and it is generally two
days, and often longer, in making the passage. Meantime
a thin, delicate membrane, called the Decidua, forms in the
Womb, and is ready to receive the Egg and detain it there,
otherwise it would pass out and be lost. This membrane
will generally last about a week, when it gradually loosens
and passes out, taking the Egg along with it. If, however,
the Egg be impregnated—in other words, if the female
have connection with a man, and the Semen comes in contact
with the Egg during this period, the Decidua from that
moment begins to grow fast to the Womb, and becomes
one of the coverings that protect the new being during the
fœtal state.</p>

<p>It will thus be understood that during the first twenty-four
hours after the Menstrual Flow has ceased, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
very little danger of impregnation, and in some females
this time might be extended to two or three days with
safety. The Zoospermes of the Semen will live for twenty-four
hours within the Womb, and it is possible for the Egg
to be impregnated by them the moment it leaves the Fallopian
Tube. We therefore state the probable time that
impregnation cannot take place to be twenty-four hours,
allowing the second twenty-four hours for the possibility
of there being living Semen in the Womb. After the Decidua
and Egg have passed out of the Womb, which is
from ten to sixteen days after the Menstrual Flow has
ceased, impregnation, or conception, is then utterly impossible
until after another monthly turn is over, and so on.
French women are famous for a clear understanding of all
the phenomena attending impregnation, and they generally
avoid it at pleasure. They know exactly when the Decidua
and Egg leaves them—they watch for it, and it is said many
of them search for it and take it away violently. At all
events, there are multitudes of the class called grisettes—females
who are content to live and cohabit with any
decent man who offers them a support—who never get into
the family way at all. Their secret is supposed to be a
physiological knowledge, or art, which enables them to
destroy the Decidua, or membrane which keeps the Egg
from passing out of the Womb. We confess we cannot
understand how so delicate an operation can be performed
by a woman upon her own person; but the thing is not
impossible.</p>

<p>Married people who desire to avoid having children
might generally attain their object by refraining from sexual
intercourse for a week or ten days after the cessation
of the Menstrual Flow; or, they might follow the precaution
recommended in our chapter on Prevention during
that period. It is supposed that conception takes place
within seven days after the monthly turn nineteen times
out of twenty. But to be on the safe side, you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wait longer—even to sixteen days—unless you can discover
when the Decidua and Egg pass off. There are certain
symptoms connected with this expulsion of the Egg
which may be detected. A thin, colorless, watery fluid
comes from the Vagina, and is often so abundant as to wet
the external parts. This will continue for some hours, and
will be followed by a grayish-white clot about the size of a
pea. The discharge of this clot is frequently accompanied
by slight pains and bearing down of the Womb. This is
the Decidua and Egg. When a woman can discover, with
certainty, the passage of this clot, she is then safe from
impregnation until after her next monthly turn.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Egg of the female is impregnated
by the male Semen is curious and interesting. In
its first state, while in the Ovary, there may be seen within
it a little dot called the Germinal Vesicle. When the Egg
is fully ripe, and just as it leaves the Ovary, this little dot
is by some unknown process expelled, leaving an open
passage to the very centre. The Egg is then ready for impregnation;
for, on passing into the Womb, if the male
Semen come in contact with it, one of the animalculæ instantly
darts into this open passage and buries itself. All
these curious operations of Nature have been discovered
by the use of the Microscope, and they are not only very
interesting, but are of great importance to mankind.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these explanations of the principles
of Impregnation, that a healthy woman may conceive under
almost any circumstances—that the idea that a first and
only connection would not impregnate is erroneous—that
the most brutal violation may cause conception—in short,
that if a female were rendered senseless by drugs, or by a
blow upon the head, this would not prevent the impregnation
of the Egg if the time were propitious.</p>

<p>Sexual enjoyment of the female during connection may
hasten the accomplishment of the desired end in various
ways, but it is by no means necessary to impregnation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
conception. Indeed, there are many females of cold temperament
who seldom experience any very pleasing sensations
during connection, and some who have no sexual
desires at all. I knew a case in Hartford, Connecticut,
many years ago, where a wealthy gentleman desired offspring.
He had lost his Penis when quite a young man;
but yet he was able, at times, to discharge Semen from the
urinary passage. He was married after the loss of his private
member, and lived with his wife—a very worthy woman—ten
years, never dreaming that he could ever become
a father. One day a physician banteringly told him
of a similar case in Vienna, where the man had actually
become a father by the use of a small glass syringe, with
which he injected his Semen into the Vagina. It was a
singular coincidence that this Hartford gentleman afterwards
became the father of two interesting little ones. He
had doubtless used the Syringe!</p>

<p>There is a class of amorous women who cannot be impregnated
at all. They are afflicted with a sort of disease
called Nymphomania, or insatiable passion for venery.
Such cases are rare, but still they occur. A young lady
patient of mine, in describing this disease, said that she
had the most irresistible disposition to lasciviousness imaginable;
that when alone she could not desist from rubbing
the parts until she became exhausted and sunk down
in perspiration: she slept well, but as soon as she was
awake the same propensity recurred. Another lady (married)
who consulted me, said she had always been brought
up virtuously, and had hitherto been well disposed; but
now a man could scarcely pass her without her experiencing
those sensations which were alone her husband’s
right.</p>

<p>Nymphomania is attended with obscenity, restlessness,
and delirium. The patients delight to talk obscenely, and
solicit men to satisfy their desires, both by words and gestures.
It is generally caused by masturbation, or undue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
irritation of the private parts when very young; and the
usual treatment is to keep them well syringed out with
castile soap and water, and wear a bag of powdered camphor
on the back of the neck. Camphor taken internally
is also good. A very little camphor introduced into the
water with which you wash the part will likewise act
favorably.</p>

<p>Young females troubled with Nymphomania, who thereby
bring themselves into disgrace, are more to be pitied
than despised: for it requires a great degree of moral firmness
for them to resist both the promptings of Nature and
those of licentious men at the same moment. Parents and
guardians should act accordingly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CAUSES_WHICH_DETERMINE_THE_SEX_OF_A_CHILD">CAUSES WHICH DETERMINE THE SEX OF A CHILD.</h2>

<p>Physiologists have given many absurd ideas on this
subject, and almost all their theories have been exploded.
In olden time it was believed that male children came
from the right ovary of the mother, while females came
from the left. Hence it was asserted that on whichever
side she lay after connection, the ovary on that side would
be impregnated. This plan of producing girls or boys at
pleasure did not work, and was discarded even before the
present minute knowledge of the principles of generation
became known. The sex of an infant is not necessarily
determined at its conception. In their unformed state, the
Testes are within the body in about the same position as
the Ovaries, and are similar to them in appearance. It is
therefore possible that certain causes may influence the sex
of the Fœtus after it has commenced its growth. As a
general rule, however, the sex of a child is influenced by
circumstances at the moment of conception. Both experiment
and observation have shown that the most ardent
and vigorous individual of the couple, whether it be the
man or the woman, will cause the sex of the child. On
the other hand, where both are nearly alike in this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
other influences must govern, and hence some couples have
children of both sexes. The relative ages of married people
frequently has an influence, because, when both are
young, the oldest of the two is usually the most vigorous,
and hence, as before stated, sex follows the predominating
parent. Some physicians lay it down as a rule, that an
elderly or middle-aged man will be sure to get boys from a
young woman, and <i>vice versa</i>. But the rule does not work
in every case. There is such a difference of sexual desires
in different people, that it is impossible for any one, except
perhaps themselves, to judge which has the most robust
sexual powers. Another cause of sex is supposed to be
the relative amorousness of the couple after impregnation
has taken place. Some women experience much pleasure
in sexual connection until they become <i>enciente</i>, and then
all their desires suddenly cease. In cases like this, where
the connection is continued, the husband would be apt to
influence the sex after conception, and then the offspring
would be male. But should circumstances prevent their
continued connection, she would, in nine cases out of ten,
give birth to a female child. To sum up, amorous females
generally breed female children, while those of a colder
temperament breed boys. When both are moderate in
their desires, children of both sexes are produced. When
the female is unnaturally amorous, (and such cases frequently
occur,) she seldom becomes impregnated at all.
The following mode of influencing the sex of the child,
some physiologists assert, is really effective, and it looks
reasonable. When the woman is just over her monthly
turn—say within two or three days—the husband may
then try for a girl. After one or two connections, let him
abstain for the next month or two, or even longer. He
thus impregnates his wife at the moment of her greatest
sexual vigor, and by abstinence he does not influence
the sex of the child after conception. Should he desire
a boy, let him keep up his connection for two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
or more after his wife has got over her monthly turn, at
the same time carefully practicing the precaution of withdrawal,
described in other pages under the head “Modes
of Preventing Conception.” At that period the wife will
have partially exhausted her amative powers, when he
can be almost certain that a boy will be the result of her
impregnation.</p>

<p>A curious fact relative to the resemblance of children to
their parents has been developed by observation. Where
a man is absent from his wife during the period of gestation,
the child is almost sure to resemble the mother. On
the other hand, an amorous father, who keeps a constant
connection with his wife during pregnancy, will cause the
child to resemble him. If a woman should become pregnant
by one man, and then cohabit constantly with another
during her pregnancy, the child would bear a resemblance
to the second man rather than to its father. This would
surely be the case if she were fond of the latter’s caresses.</p>

<p>It often happens that a married couple will have “a run”
of children of one sex, and then turn round and breed
those of the opposite sex. This may be accounted for by
the failing health, and consequent vigor, of the predominating
parent. Thus if a woman begins to breed boys,
and after having had several, turns round and breeds a
number of girls, it is a pretty sure sign that the sexual
vigor of her husband is on the wane, or that his bodily
health is failing. Should girls come first in rotation, and
boys afterwards, the mother’s generative vigor may be suspected
of falling off. These are, however, mere suggestive
ideas; though readers may understand from them the principle
upon which Nature forms the two sexes. I have no
doubt that a careful and practical study of the subject
may sometimes enable parents to elect the sex of their offspring,
on the principle we have explained; but there are
so many curious phases in the phenomena of procreation,
that any certainty on the subject is out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_FOETUS">DEVELOPMENT OF THE FŒTUS.</h2>

<p>The escape or expulsion of the Germinal Vesicle from
the Ovum, or Egg, leaves, as we have already explained, a
passage to its very centre, thus enabling the Zoospermes, or
male animalculæ, to enter. If both are perfect and healthy,
impregnation is then complete. The first change that now
takes place is observed in the Vitellus, or yellow of the Egg,
which at once forms itself into a mass of little globules;
and it is a singular fact that these are always a fixed even
number, generally beginning with four or six, and so multiplying
or doubling—always, however, keeping the number
even. If by chance they should end their self-arrangement
by an odd number, a perfect being could not be
formed—the impregnation would end either in an abortion
or an unnatural growth in the Womb. It generally takes
two or three days for the globules to arrange themselves,
and meantime the Zoosperme, or male principle, remains
dormant. The globules soon begin to form themselves
either into Testicles or Ovaries, as the sex may be, of
the future being. At the same time myriads of smaller
globules break off from them and spread all round the
Zoosperme, which is soon entirely covered or coated with
them. They now grow together and form the skin. The
Zoosperme is supposed to be the head and spine, and the
globules, which thus form the skin, shut out our view from
observing any further formations. The Testicles, or Ovaries,
as the case may be, are now quite prominent, though
we cannot yet determine the sex, even with the most powerful
microscope, nor is there any form to the new being
other than the original shape of the male animalculæ.</p>

<p>After the formation of the skin and procreative organs,
as stated, the little being again shows signs of life, and
struggles in its Egg until it frees itself from all the membranous
substances which surround it, and is enabled to
turn round at its pleasure. Its movements are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
rapid and lively, and they doubtless are necessary to the
formations and changes which soon begin to take place.
At the end of twelve days the Ovum is found to be enlarged
to the size of a pea, and its whole organization may
be seen with the naked eye. It is coated with two membranes,
between which is a gelatinous substance, and the
interior is filled with a fluid in which the fœtus swims
about at pleasure. On a close examination, the mouth
and eyes can be seen about the fifteenth day. The eyes
first appear on the side of the head, and, as the Fœtus
grows, they move round to their position. In ten days
more we see the future being in form and size like a small
ant. At the end of the first month it has increased to the
size of a honey-bee, and the arms begin to grow—first appearing
like small warts on the body. They sprout straight
out, and are then folded together on the breast. At this
time the head is as large as all the rest of the body, and
the features can be distinguished. The legs have not yet
appeared, but the lower extremities are like a tail. At two
months the legs and feet appear, the toes being united similar
to frogs’ feet. During the tenth week the eyes show
their lids, the mouth becomes more prominent, and the
ears may be seen. The heart is now fully developed, but
as yet contains no blood. The brain shows its form and
substance. The next change brings red blood to the larger
veins and to the heart, and at the end of three months the
shape and form of the future being is nearly perfect, weighing
less than three ounces. The next process of Nature is
the thickening of the skin, and so rapid now is the growth
that within one month the Fœtus fully doubles in weight.
During the fourth month the bones begin to ossify, the
uterus rises in the abdomen, and we are then enabled to
determine the sex. This change is what is usually called
quickening, and it corresponds with the time of breaking
the shell in birds. At the end of the fifth month the finger-nails
appear, and fine silky hair begins to grow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
head. At seven months the being is generally perfect, the
bones are firm and hard, and it weighs about three pounds.
The intellectual faculties are not developed, however. The
eighth and ninth months merely increase the size and
strength of the child.</p>

<p>Our Engravings show the relative sizes and position of a
Fœtus, as it lies in the Womb, at three several stages of
gestation. They are original drawings from anatomical
figures in wax in the New York Anatomical Museum.</p>

<p>The child, previous to birth, never takes nutriment in
by its mouth, for that is always firmly closed until after
birth. Its food during gestation is probably derived from
the blood of its mother through the umbilical cord, or
navel-string, which likewise supplies its veins and arteries
until the very hour of birth. An artery and two veins
pass through this cord. There is sometimes an impediment
in the circulation of new-born infants, which is called
the blue disease, and for which there is no remedy. In
these cases the body is of a leaden blue color, and the child
appears sleepy and inanimate. Such children usually die
before they are a year old, though sometimes they live four
or five years.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="SEXUAL_INDULGENCE">SEXUAL INDULGENCE.</h2>

<p>Most men are of an amative disposition, and after the
age of puberty have frequent desires to indulge in sexual
intercourse. Some feel this desire so overpoweringly that
everything else is forgone, all risks are run, and consequences
madly braved, merely for the gratification of a
momentary passion. Females, on the contrary, are seldom
troubled with sexual desires; and among those who risk
their reputation and their social existence in the gratification
of illicit love, few are prompted to the act by the amative
feeling. It is the idea that they are loved, and the
wish to impart pleasure to the loved object, that overpowers
their own judgment. When once a man has gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the love of a true female heart, it lies in his power to use
her person at will. Very few of the weaker sex can withstand
the promptings of disinterested affection; but their
sexual passions seldom lead them astray.</p>

<p>In sexual union, the ecstatic point of enjoyment is termed
in medical phrase the Orgasm, and in some men it is so
intense that all consciousness ceases, and a perfect insensibility
to everything around is produced for the moment.
The Orgasm is usually followed by a state of dreamy languor
or exhaustion, which induces sleep. In women the
Orgasm is not always experienced, and some females of
cold temperament do not know what it is, though they are
often excited, and feel a certain degree of pleasure. When
it does occur in women, it is often even more intense than
in the other sex, causing convulsive motions and involuntary cries.
It does not exhaust the system, as in the male,
and the dreamy languor is more pleasing, and will often
continue for an hour or more. It sometimes happens that
a female of amative desires is never satisfied with one
Orgasm, but craves frequent and repeated intercourse, as
the indulgence does not exhaust her as it does her partner.
Such a woman, unless she be possessed of great moral
firmness, is apt either to injure the health of her husband,
or to indulge in illicit love. Happily, cases like this are
rare. The male can have but one perfect Orgasm at the
same time, because he must secrete a new supply of Semen
before another can take place. Men do frequently attempt
the second, third, and even more frequent connections
within a few hours, but the subsequent ones are spasmodic
and hurtful. Those who value their health, and desire to
enjoy true sexual pleasure, should never attempt these repetitions,
as they permanently injure the organs, and impart
to them an unnatural craving for frequent intercourse.
Two or three days should occur between the periods of
sexual indulgence to enable a man to enjoy it in full perfection.
The female Orgasm, not being produced by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
secretion, may be enjoyed without particular injury, though
it is sometimes apt to affect the nerves. In most females it
is very difficult to be produced—in others it will occur
during sleep, and be entirely absent while in the act of coition.
Orgasms in the female may therefore be experienced
without the least licentious idea being entertained. This is
sometimes the case with a class of women called “mediums”
by the Spiritualists. The same temperaments are
those which can be put in a mesmeric slumber. Women
of great devotional feeling are generally of this class,
though not always. Dr. Hollick tells us of a lady much
addicted to mesmeric practices, who wrote to him her experience.
She confessed that whenever she was capable
of being acted upon, mesmerically, the mesmeric state was
always preceded by sexual excitement—often amounting
to a perfect Orgasm—and that if this feeling was not experienced,
she could never be mesmerized. Sometimes so
many Orgasms would follow each other that she would
become completely exhausted and faint away. According
to her statement, the mesmeric sleep, or ecstasy, was nothing
but the dreamy languor following a sexual Orgasm.
There are some mysteries connected with these peculiarities
of the female system which Science has thus far failed
to discover; but new facts come to light every day, and it
is probable we may yet solve them. The sexual feeling in
females is often curious and peculiar, and I have no doubt
that the mind and imagination control it in some unexplained
manner. A case occurred in France where a female
enjoyed the feeling to excess with one man, while
with others she could enjoy nothing, though these latter
persons were quite as agreeable and pleasing to her. This
fact shows that there are persons of opposite sexes naturally
adapted to each other, and where such people marry
they are generally happy in the marriage state.</p>

<p>Sexual intercourse is no doubt beneficial to health in all
fully developed persons, and in some females it is actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
necessary to preserve their lives. It is a proper stimulant
to the nervous system, and serves as a sort of safety-valve
when the vital functions are too active. The statistics of
the world show that married people are longer lived on the
average than single ones, and it is quite certain that as a
general rule they enjoy more perfect health. M. Pidoux,
a French physician who had practiced extensively in the
Nunneries, assures us that almost invariably the Nuns are
afflicted with floodings, with an absence of their monthly
turns, and with other uterine diseases, after they reach a
certain age.</p>

<p>The proper time for sexual indulgence is an important
consideration, inasmuch as carelessness in this respect may
tend to dyspepsia, indigestion, and other affections of the
stomach. Persons who are predisposed to such diseases
should never have sexual intercourse just before eating,
nor very soon after a full meal. Its peculiar effect on the
stomach is calculated to weaken digestion, particularly on
the part of the male; and many a miserable dyspeptic
might trace his unhappiness to imprudent acts of sexual
intercourse. From two to three hours after or before eating
a full meal, is the proper time for this business. Both
the body and the mind should be calm and at perfect rest—no
troubles or bickerings should disturb the perfect harmony
of the amorous pair—nor should the thoughts be
allowed to stray away from the matter at issue. Tristram
Shandy tells us that he owed the whole misfortunes of his
life to an idle remark made by his mother at the very moment
of his conception!</p>

<p>A full enjoyment of sexual intercourse depends as much
upon the proper time chosen, the condition of the parties,
and their mutual sympathies, as upon the fact that they
are really persons of the opposite sex. It should not be
indulged in except when there is a natural desire and a
vigorous impulse. It should be avoided whenever it tends
to produce a depression of spirits, or the least debility. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
should never be indulged in during intoxication, or where
the sexual organs of either party are diseased or out of
order. It ought to be entirely abstained from during six
or seven days after the commencement of the female
monthly turn, and for one month after child-birth. It
would be better, for both mother and child, if no sexual
intercourse was indulged in during the whole period of
suckling her infant, but as that abstinence is not to be expected
from ordinary men, I advise as little connection as
possible during that time. And should connection with a
suckling mother prematurely bring on her menses, (as it
sometimes does,) she must immediately wean her child.</p>

<p>Female prostitutes never enjoy their sexual connections
with strangers—they are mere passive instruments—while
the male only relieves himself of a superabundance of Semen.
Too frequent intercourse is quite as unnatural;
those who practice it rob themselves of more than half the
pleasure they seek. A man in robust health who has refrained
from sexual pleasures, may, it is true, enjoy such
intercourse once in twenty-four hours for several days together;
but he could not attain the full enjoyment from
one female. He must then rest. I speak of the highest
degree of sexual pleasures. Many newly married couples
give no limit to their indulgences; and it is to such that I
say, you deny yourselves of the real pleasures of married
life. A little philosophy, and some experiments on the
hints given, would render the married state a state of more
refined pleasures than it now presents to a large class of
mankind.</p>

<p>The particular food which is calculated to stimulate the
sexual organs is shell-fish, or sea fish of any kind, and
turtle, as these generally contain phosphorus. Among
vegetables may be mentioned celery, parsnips, onions, peppers,
asparagus, tomatoes, Lima beans, &amp;c. Mushrooms
and truffles are a stimulant, as is also mint, sage, pennyroyal,
thyme, and spices of all kinds, especially pepper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nutmeg. Canvas-back Duck, in proper season, is of excellent
stimulating qualities; and for puddings, sago, tapioca
and arrowroot. For drinks take porter and strong beer,
wines, or coffee. Spirits are too exhilerating, and cause a
reaction.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_AVOID_CHILD-GETTING">HOW TO AVOID CHILD-GETTING.</h2>

<p>The effectual Prevention of Conception is a subject in
which everybody is interested. No class of mankind in
civilized life desires an unlimited number of offspring;
yet Nature has made prevention a somewhat difficult task.
Persons of energy and resolution can, however, fully accomplish
their object in this respect if they will but discard
the notion that the delights of sexual intercourse are
marred by the withdrawal of the male organ just before
the discharge of Semen takes place. This plan injures
neither party, nor does it really diminish the pleasurable
sensations of the connection. If you once form the <i>habit</i>
of withdrawal, you will find it to be a far more desirable
and satisfactory mode than it at first appears. I know
that the plan is discouraged by many physicians, and has
been pronounced a kind of <i>Onanism</i> on the part of the
male; but it is not so. If properly performed, the act of
coition is as pleasurable, as healthy and as complete as it
can be when the Semen is fully injected. The cleanliness
of this practice is also a great desideratim, as females of
any degree of refinement can understand. I would then
suggest to married people the following rule: Always
carry to bed a clean napkin, which is to be kept in the
hand of the male during the nuptial act. It will then be
a very easy matter to place this napkin in a proper position
to receive the Semen on withdrawal, at the instant it
would otherwise be injected into the body of the female.
If you do it at the proper moment, no pleasure is lost to
either party; and habit will soon make you expert in this
respect. This is the most certain mode of preventing conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that can be adopted, but as it cannot be carried out
except by the prompt action of the husband, other plans
are sometimes necessary to give the wife confidence, and
make her feel sure of success. These we will proceed to
explain as minutely as possible.</p>

<p>The judicious use of an ordinary female syringe, with
cold water alone, or a weak solution of white vitriol or
other stringent in cold water, immediately after coition,
will in most cases prevent conception. The syringe must
be a large one, if made of metal, and should be filled several
times, and its contents injected as far up as possible.
The India-rubber syringe has of late years nearly superseded
metal ones, and is beautifully adapted to the business
of preventing conception. By the use of this article a female
may inject as much fluid as she pleases, through an
elastic tube, quite as far up into her person as is necessary.
The mixture should be prepared beforehand, and, with the
syringe, kept by her bed-side, as success often depends upon
promptness in using it. If used immediately, with a weak
solution, as hereinafter stated, there is very little danger
but that a woman may keep herself safe from child-bearing
as long as she pleases. Solutions of Alum, Sulphate of
Zinc, Chloride of Zinc, Sulphate of Iron, &amp;c., will kill the
animalculæ of the Semen, if injected with sufficient force
and profuseness. If the woman rises <i>instantly</i> and performs
the duty, she will probably be successful. If solutions
are used in preference to pure cold water, it is better
to use water at last as a rinsing process. The use of the
syringe, so far from injuring the female, keeps the part
clean and healthy, and tends to promote general good
health. In commencing this practice, you should first accustom
yourself to the use of cold water by degrees. Use
but little at first, and let it not be too cold. Increase the
quantity and the coldness gradually, until at last the feeling
will be refreshing and agreeable. India-rubber syringes
can be purchased at almost any respectable drug-store in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
New York, at from two to three dollars. We can furnish
the best article to our customers for three dollars. It is an
instrument that every family should keep in the house to
be used in case of sickness, if for no other purpose.</p>

<p>Either of the following lotions may be used, as we have
explained, in preventing conception. Sulphate of Iron is
the favorite article which our quack doctors recommend.
They usually charge five dollars for an ounce paper of it,
including directions for use; whereas the cost in New
York, at a drug-store, is less than fifty cents a pound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lotions.</span>—1. Dissolve half an ounce, or more, of pulverized
Alum in two quarts of rain-water. If you can get
Sulphate of Zinc, put in that with the Alum, in equal quantities,
say a quarter of an ounce each.</p>

<p>2. Two drams (quarter of an ounce) Sulphate of Zinc
in two quarts of soft water. Or, one-third of an ounce
will perhaps do better, if used alone.</p>

<p>3. Chloride of Zinc, (liquid,) half a fluid ounce to two
quarts of water. You can buy an ounce phial full, and use
half at a time, or a two or four ounce phial, and use in proportion.
If you prefer to make the lotion stronger, it will
do no harm.</p>

<p>4. Take one and a half to two ounces Sulphate of Iron
and mix it with two quarts of soft water. This is a mixture
which any New York quack will charge you from
three to five dollars for, and will pretend it is a great and
wonderful secret.</p>

<p>Another plan which the wife may adopt for the prevention
of conception is as follows: Procure a fine sponge at
a drug-store, and cut off a piece of it about the size of a
walnut; then make a fine silk string by twisting together
some threads of sewing silk; tie one end of the string to
the piece of sponge; wet the sponge in a weak solution of
sulphate of iron, or of any of the solutions before mentioned
as fatal to the animalculæ of the Semen. Before connection,
insert the piece of sponge far up into your person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
You can place it entirely out of the way by the use of a
smooth stick of the proper size and shape. The string
will hang out, but will be no obstacle. After the act is
over, you withdraw the sponge, and if you have a syringe,
use that also. This method is pronounced by some physicians
to be a sure one, and the only objection to it is that
it is apt to mar the pleasure experienced by the wife.
Some of our quack doctors charge five dollars for this information.
It is true, they furnish a certain mysterious
powder to make a mixture of in which to wet the sponge
used; but the powder is nothing more than sulphate of
iron, or some astringent similar to those named by us.</p>

<p>Coverings for the Penis, which are used in Europe to
avoid contracting sexual diseases from prostitutes, must
necessarily prevent conception. With one of these coverings
(which are now made beautifully with a preparation
of India-rubber) a man may be certain that he will never
impregnate his wife. But the enjoyment of the nuptial
act is not so complete as a naked Penis affords, hence the
covering, or sheath, is not very popular. The cost of the
best article is about three dollars a dozen.</p>

<p>Some men tie up the scrotum to prevent a discharge
of Semen, and thus hope to avoid impregnating the female;
but this method is exceedingly hurtful, as it forces
the discharge into the bladder, from whence it passes off
with the urine. Such a practice will in a short time so derange
the procreative organs as to send all the Semen into
the bladder as fast as it generates, and the effect on health
will be a wasting away of vitality in the same manner as
if the patient constantly practiced self-pollution.</p>

<p>I have thus given the only safe methods of preventing
conception that are known. The first one—the withdrawal—is
an art to be acquired by the husband. It is a plan
which every person of good breeding should adopt for its
cleanliness alone, if for no other reason. Once habituated
to this precaution while enjoying the nuptial bed, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wonder how rational beings can pursue a different course.
It is indeed a refinement of social intercourse—a triumph
of mind which thus controls even the laws and instincts
of our nature!</p>

<h2 id="EFFECTS_OF_TOO_EARLY_SEXUAL_INTERCOURSE">EFFECTS OF TOO EARLY SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.</h2>

<p>One of the greatest evils to mankind is a too free sexual
indulgence by young men and boys. It not only injures
their vital powers, but affects their intellects. Parents
should watch their boys to observe whether they are of
amorous temperament. If they are found to be so, a prudent
person can find means to persuade or prevent their
indulgence of sexual passion. If a boy is allowed free and
habitual intercourse with females before he has attained
his growth, it will not only prevent the full development
of his body, but also of his intellect. This is a well known
fact in physiology; and by this very means many youths,
who would otherwise become distinguished, have settled
down into mediocrity, with scarcely sufficient energy of
character to earn a livelihood. In a certain family in one
of the country towns on the Hudson River, three sons were
born. The two oldest afterwards became distinguished
men. It was a family that inherited naturally the fine
talents of their father, combined with the extraordinary
robust and nervous energy of the mother. It was impossible
that such a couple could produce other than intellectual
and vigorous offspring. The third son, up to the
age of twelve or thirteen years, promised to be the flower
of the family. His education was progressing favorably.
He was the pride of his parents. Years rolled along, and
it seemed as though the boy stood still at thirteen or fourteen.
He was amiable, and learned his lessons well enough,
but all the energy and fire of youth seemed to have vanished.
He did not care to join in the manly sports of his
elder brothers, but in a listless and dreamy mood preferred
to stay at home. His parents began to have fears for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
health, though he did not complain. The father finally
took him to New York, and consulted a physician of eminence.
The doctor asked some questions relative to his
habits, but the simple and candid answers of the lad did
not lead to anything explaining the real cause of his malady.
At parting, the physician said to his father, that if
the lad lived in New York, he should pronounce his case
one of too early sexual indulgence, unless he practiced
the silent vice of Onanism. “Are there no females in
your neighborhood with whom the lad could by any possibility
associate?” inquired the doctor. “He never goes in
company at all,” was the reply. “What servants have
you?” “Two excellent girls who have been years in the
family—the idea of an illicit association there is preposterous.”
“His mother is positive that he does not practice
the solitary habit?” “Yes!” “Well, I can do nothing
for him; but yet I would like to see the boy again. With
your permission I will run up to your place in a week or
two.” “We shall be happy to see you.”</p>

<p>The doctor found out the secret of the boy’s malady
within twenty-four hours after his arrival. He had cohabited
constantly with one of the maids from the age of
twelve and a half years until he was sixteen! The lad
was saved only because of his youth. He partially outgrew
this severe shock to his nervous system; but yet
never fully developed the intellectual powers with which
Nature had endowed him. Young men who marry too
soon are in the same category. There is not one in a dozen
who is fully developed even at twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p>The case of the son of Napoleon I., Emperor of the
French, was similar to that above related. At the age of
fifteen or sixteen he began his career of sexual indulgence,
which ended his life at the early age of twenty-one years.
He, too, was an amiable, inoffensive and studious youth—beloved
by his grandfather and by the whole Austrian
Court; and though the son of the most energetic man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
modern times has produced, yet, from his quiet and effeminate
life, he scarcely attracted the least public attention.</p>

<p>The present Sultan of Turkey is a living evidence of the
effects of too early indulgence in sexual intercourse. He
is the son of a brave and vigorous soldier, and with proper
culture would doubtless have become a great and good
man. <span class="smcap">Abdul Medjid</span> has been over twenty years on the
Turkish throne, and has hitherto impressed those who
came in contact with him simply as a weak and indolent
young man, with good intentions, but with neither nerve
nor energy to carry them out. It was generally believed,
and with good reason, that in his case, as in that of so
many others of his race, the sensual indulgence begun in
his boyhood had destroyed every trace of masculine decision.
No one who watched his dreamy, listless expression,
and saw his relaxed muscles, and lolling attitude as he
rode on horseback through the streets, could help feeling
that he reigned rather in virtue of foreign support than of
his own ability to command obedience.</p>

<h2 id="RESULTS_OF_SEXUAL_ABUSES">RESULTS OF SEXUAL ABUSES.</h2>

<p>It was not our intention in this work to speak of Onanism
and Masturbation. These unnatural practices are so
generally known to be destructive to the sexual powers,
and of health, that young people scarcely need advice on
the subject. But it may be interesting to know the results
of such practices, and of the abuse of the sexual organs
by over indulgence. Some constitutions experience a sort
of consumption which arises from the dorsal portion of
the spinal marrow. No fever accompanies it, the appetite
continues good, but the patient gradually wastes away.
Women thus affected describe a crawling sensation down
the spine. Men lose their seminal fluid in their urine,
having a ringing in the ears, a weakness of vision, near-sightedness,
and their intellectual capacities are weakened
and confused. In short, the whole nervous system is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
prostrated. Excess of venery is likewise the first
exciting cause of many painful diseases, such as rheumatism,
neuralgia, epilepsy, convulsions, &amp;c. Young married
people are apt to indulge too much in sexual intercourse,
and many a man lives a life of misery from ill health originated
in this manner. Women are not affected so much
by over indulgence as by Masturbation. Delicacy not allowing
an ardent woman to tell her husband of her needs,
she is apt to relieve herself by this unnatural practice.
There are, however, but few women who crave sexual intercourse.
The excess is generally on the part of the man.
Moderation in sexual pleasures is the key to health in a
great many cases where the patient is hopelessly lamenting
his sad fate. Sometimes a man will indulge to excess without
experiencing much inconvenience, when suddenly a fit
of palsy or epilepsy prostrates him, and leaves him a hopeless
invalid for life. I remember an interesting case in
point. A man of robust health and strong sexual powers,
married at the age of nineteen. From that time until the
age of forty-five, he lived temperately, was regular in his
habits, and never knew a day of sickness. He had always
the reputation of being fond of a variety of women—indeed,
this seemed to be the one passion of his life, for he
dissipated a handsome property in settling crim. con. suits,
and paying for bastard children. As he advanced in years
his passion seemed to increase, and it was said that he supported
five different mistresses at the time of the occurrence
of the event I am now about to relate. One day
when he was writing a letter, he felt a peculiar twitching
of the forefinger with which he held his pen. This twitching
sensation increased so much that he called on me for
advice. I replied, “Let the women alone, for that is a
symptom of palsy.” Within two days thereafter he was
struck down and lost the use of his hands, his right arm,
and partially of his right side. Ten years have passed,
and this man, who had previously enjoyed excellent health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
is still as helpless as on the first day of his misfortune. He
has consulted distinguished physicians—American, French
and German—but there is no help for him. All agree that
relief is impossible, but that he may live for many years
an imbecile, palsied man.</p>

<p>To sum up: If you wish to maintain your intellectual
faculties intact—to enjoy good health—to be cheerful in
the decline of life—to keep your strength, your imagination,
your memory, and your eye-sight unimpaired, refrain
from too frequent intercourse with women. Once a week
is quite often enough for this indulgence, and more than
twice a week is positively hurtful. Some men may sneer
at this advice, perhaps; but to such we say, look back upon
your life. Are you as perfect, both physically and intellectually,
as you would have been had you curbed your
sexual desires?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="POSITION_DURING_SEXUAL_INTERCOURSE">POSITION DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.</h2>

<p>There is one phase of sexual matters that physiological
writers seldom allude to, but which should be understood
by married people, viz.: the position of their bodies during
the nuptial act. Any unnatural performance of this act
is apt to impair the health of the female, and many women
have been seriously injured and rendered miserable for life
by the beastliness of their husbands in this respect. Unnatural
positions will cause derangements and bearing
down of the womb, produce fluor albus, or whites, and
sometimes will originate tumors and fungi in the private
parts. A woman of delicate mould and constitution might
be fatally injured in this manner; and no female, however
robust, can enjoy sexual intercourse except in the position
intended by Nature. For a full and perfect enjoyment of
sexual pleasures, there must be first a mutual fondness or
sentimental feeling, called love. Where this does not exist,
the married pair should, in their associations, endeavor to
be in as good humor as possible, and to tolerate each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
caresses with the hope that love may grow between them.
Marriages have occurred where the bride felt an antipathy
almost amounting to disgust towards the embraces of her
husband, but afterwards, on a close intimacy and free acquaintance,
became not only reconciled, but really fond of
him. Delicacy and watchfulness on the part of the husband
will often enable him to make himself agreeable to a
woman who at first has no sympathy with him whatever.
From the peculiar organization of females, there are times
when a husband’s caresses may be unpleasant and irksome
even to a loving wife: if he is reasonable and consciencious,
he will not fail to observe this, and will abstain from
intruding on her privicy on such occasions.</p>

<p>A man who will force his caresses upon his wife can be
ranked only with “the brutes that perish.” Of this class
also are those who “go in unto their wives” after the
manner of brutes. The natural position to which we have
alluded suggests itself to every married pair who possess
the most remote particle of love for each other. But to
make it unmistakable, we would say, that the female
should lie upon her back, with her legs straight down—or
if the legs are raised, they should be but slightly elevated.
All other positions are unnatural and unhealthy. I could
illustrate this fact by several cases in point, but the details
are too disgusting. Suffice it then to say, that I have
known females suffering from painful diseases caused by
sexual connection in a standing position—in a position
where their partners approached them from behind, and
also in one case where the woman was forced or persuaded
to lie on her back with her knees up against her chest.
No female can desire such intercourse as this, because she
cannot enjoy it. It is therefore the libidinous antics of her
companion that compels her to it. Very few men of decent
breeding require the caution I have here given, but if there
be half-a-dozen who profit by it, I shall be compensated for
thus alluding to a delicate subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="DISPOSITION_AND_INTELLECTHOW_FORMED">DISPOSITION AND INTELLECT—HOW FORMED.</h2>

<p>It is wisely ordered by Nature that genius, and a high
order of intellect, shall not, as a general rule, descend to
children. If mankind could impart to offspring an intellectual
superiority, we should probably have too many
geniuses in the world, and too few workers. The animal
propensities, the peculiar disposition, the various passions,
the form, features, &amp;c.—these, and other peculiarities of
parents are always transmitted to their children; but that
lofty, soul-inspiring sentimentality which enlarges the reasoning
faculties and bestows mental distinction upon its recipients,
seems to be a peculiar gift from the Deity itself.</p>

<p>Some physiologists assert that Nature does not endow
the children of distinguished men so bountifully as those
of less exalted capacities, and assign as a reason that great
minds have their weaknesses and their follies, which are
apt to show themselves in a marked manner at the moment
they are begetting their children. I do not endorse
this doctrine, but suspect that men are beholden rather to
their mothers than to their paternal parents for whatever
intellectual gifts God, in his wisdom, has bestowed upon
them. A healthy, well developed, and naturally intelligent
woman will have smart and intellectual children, even
though her husband may be a ninny. If you want intelligent
children, then, look you out a wife who has a soul
above street yarn and love stories. But should you select
the best woman from a thousand, you will scarcely find in
her a wife capable of breeding you a very moderate genius.
It is thought by some people that the state of the intellect at
the moment of the nuptial act marks the mind of the child.
I do not believe this; for if a crop of geniuses could be
raised by minds specially tutored for the occasion, who
doubts but that the world would be full of them?</p>

<p>In looking for a mother for his children, a man should
seek a woman of different temperament from himself. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he is lymphatic and good natured, let him find a wife who
is nervous and irritable; and <i>vice versa</i>. If he be of a sandy
complexion, or fair-haired, with blue eyes, let him choose
one of those luscious brunettes, with flashing black eyes,
and a resolution as firm as a rock. On the contrary, if he
be dark complexioned, impatient and passionate, let him
sacrifice and enslave a mild and blue-eyed blonde of the
cold North. Choose you always a woman of intellect,
and if with that, you have one of a temperament and complexion
opposite to your own, your children will be distinguished
for something—they will not live a life of drudgery
and dependence—and they <i>may be</i> geniuses. The selection
of a conjugal partner is one of the most important events
of life, in either man or woman. Too little attention is
generally paid to it.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TEMPERAMENTSHOW_DISTINGUISHED">THE TEMPERAMENTS—HOW DISTINGUISHED.</h2>

<p>In the course of this treatise we have alluded to the
Temperaments of different individuals, and it may therefore
be interesting to describe them. A person of a Lymphatic
temperament has a languid, good-natured look,
sleepy eyes, and the face is soft, round and full. A Sanguine
temperament is represented by an earnest, anxious
countenance, large intelligent eyes, prominent nose, robust
health, and a strong constitution. The Bilious temperament
usually presents a strong marked countenance, yellow
skin, bulging eyes, projecting lips, full muscular habit,
and not very fleshy. Persons of Nervous temperament
are usually (though not always) thin and spare: their features
are firm set, lines of countenance harsh, constitution
delicate, and intellectual qualities of the first order.</p>

<p>Men of genius may be ranked as follows: Sanguine-nervous
are usually great writers, divines, musicians, or artists.
Sanguine-bilious, great generals, politicians, statesmen, inventors,
business men, or distinguished in any calling requiring
much energy and industry. Sanguine-lymphatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
are frequently persons of great talent, enterprise, and distinction,
and are generally long lived; but they seldom
make any considerable display of their abilities, or become
men of mark.</p>

<p>Lazy, inefficient and irresolute people, are in most cases
constitutionally so from a lack of sanguinity in their temperaments.
Some men and women are so constituted that
they never can rise above drudges in society; for if they
are industrious they have no confidence in themselves.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="THE_NATURAL_LAWS_OF_MARRIAGE_AND_OF_THE_TEMPERAMENTS">THE NATURAL LAWS OF MARRIAGE, AND OF THE TEMPERAMENTS.</h2>

<p>It is well known that marriages between near relatives
produce unhealthy and imperfect children, but the causes
of such a result are not generally understood. These
causes extend far beyond the circle of a family, for it is
quite as improper for two persons of the same temperament
to marry, as it would be for a brother and a sister.
The laws of the Temperaments of the human family may
be enumerated as follows:</p>

<p>1st. When both parties to a marriage are constitutionally
the same, there will probably be no children.</p>

<p>2d. The vital elements are incompatible with each other,
and if children are born to parents who are alike in this
respect, they will probably be idiotic, or rachitic.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>3d. When parties who marry are nearly alike—if their
temperaments differ only in part—they will have children
who may live to adult age, but who will then probably die
of tubercular phthisis (consumption). In illustration of
this, I have known whole families of children to be taken
off by consumption between the ages of twenty-two and
twenty-seven years, where this disease had not previously
existed in the families of the parents or their progenitors.</p>

<p>4th. If the constitutions of a married couple assimilate
to the extent of one-half, their children will be apt to die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
before the first seven years. The diseases of such children
are tubercles in the glands of the intestines, or in the membranes
of the brain.</p>

<p>5th. When persons marry who are alike in temperament,
and whose constitutions materially differ, a majority
of their children will be still-born, and none will probably
live to be two years old.</p>

<p>6th. When one of the parties to a marriage is exclusively
vital, and the other similar, but of a nervous and melancholy
turn, the children will generally be promising.</p>

<p>7th. To produce smart and healthy children, one of the
parties should be of sanguine-bilious temperament, with
good vitality, and the other of a quiet, lymphatic turn.</p>

<p>Scrofulous forms of disease result exclusively from marriages
illustrated by the first five laws above given. More
than half the children that die are those of constitutionally
incompatible parents. People who live in health to a good
old age, owe more to their parents giving them a sound
constitution than to any efforts of their own to preserve
health. So many diseases are traced by skillful physicians
to improper marriages, that the study of Physiology, and
of the human temperaments, seems to be as necessary to
young people as the most common branches of education.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the human race, marriages are oftener
contracted from instinct than from motives of policy; and
individuals of opposite temperaments are apt to experience
that natural attraction towards each other that results in
marriage. But marriages of interest are still occurring sufficiently
frequent to fill our lunatic, idiot, and deaf-and-dumb
asylums, and we are glad to notice that the subject is attracting
attention, and that new laws are proposed to prevent
the marriage of blood relatives.</p>

<p>It is also proper to state that there should not be an extreme
disproportion in stature between a married pair. A
delicate, slightly formed, small woman, whose pelvis is
small, should not marry a large robust man. If she does,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
her offspring will be too large for her to bring into the
world without much suffering, and sometimes mutilation,
and destruction of health. This is also the fate of many
girls of small stature who become mothers at too early an
age, and before the hip and other bones, which form the
cavity through which the infant comes into the world, is
sufficiently developed.</p>

<p>Early marriages (if not too early) are better than late
ones, for the natural state of mankind, after puberty, is a
rational association of the two sexes. Woman was adorned
by Providence with her graces and charms to delight
the opposite sex, and she possesses those graces in full perfection
only while she is young. At that period she is
indued with power to give and to inherit a sort of terrestrial
paradise, to multiply her species, and to become matron,
queen, and mother. Her early ripeness proves that
it was the intention of Providence that mankind, while
young, should settle in matrimony, and exercise those gifts
which reproduce their equals. In many young people the
marriage state, when properly enjoyed, augments the energies
of the sanguineous system; the distended arteries
carry warmth and animation through the body; the muscles
become vigorous; the walk is more free; the voice
firmer—in short, both men and women by this means improve
their health, strength and beauty, and assist the development
of their intellectual faculties.</p>

<h2 id="ON_THE_INFLUENCE_OF_VITAL_FORCE">ON THE INFLUENCE OF VITAL FORCE.</h2>

<p>The base of the brain is the source and foundation of
motion, thinking, and feeling in the human body. The
breadth of it indicates the vigor, and its depth the tenacity
of life. Men generally have the base of the brain more
developed than women, and as a consequence exhibit, in
both body and mind, more of what is called force of character.
A man whose brain is very full at the base, seldom,
if ever, suffers from chronic forms of disease, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
never dies from consumption, except in old age when the
brain is decayed. His ailings will be confined to inflammatory
diseases, gout and rheumatism. Men of this class
are never drudges. They are usually energetic, either for
good or evil, and are more apt to be leaders of their fellow-men
than otherwise. Vital force is as necessary to the promotion
of health as pure blood. Those who are deficient
of it sooner or later become afflicted with some functional
form of disease. Intellectual men of this class usually
pursue the profession of a minister, a physician or a college
professor, though they make very indifferent doctors
or teachers. They do not possess sufficient force or energy
of character to make their talents and worth appreciated
by the multitude. The trustees of schools and colleges
employ them without making any inquiries as to their
ability to govern youth, and the consequence is frequent
difficulties and fruitless disputes with their pupils.</p>

<h2 id="TENACITY_OF_LIFE_AND_LONGEVITY">TENACITY OF LIFE AND LONGEVITY.</h2>

<p>The depth of the base of the brain is a true index of
vital tenacity, or duration of life in any individual. This
depth varies in different persons from less than a quarter
of an inch up to an inch and a quarter.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A full inch in
an individual fifty years of age indicates a life of eighty or
ninety years. One-half to five-eighths of an inch shows
that though the person may live many years, yet he has
not the vital power to resist formidable assaults of disease.
And those persons whose base of brain presents a depth
of less than half an inch, must be exceedingly careful of
their health, and may expect to die from the most trivial
cause. On the contrary, those with three-fourths of an
inch, and above it, will probably survive the most powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
attacks of disease. The base of the brain, being the
seat of vitality in all animals, the exact size of it shows
the quantum of life possessed by any individual. Hereditary
diseases may be excepted, in certain cases.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_DETECT_PREGNANCY">HOW TO DETECT PREGNANCY.</h2>

<p>Almost every married woman considers the stoppage
of her usual monthly turns a warning that she is in the
family way; and this will hold true in nine cases out of
ten. Nevertheless, in some women the menses continue
for a couple of months or more after impregnation takes
place. So, also, there are many other causes for the suppression
of the menses, and the failure of the monthly turn
is not, therefore, conclusive evidence of impregnation.
Other peculiarities may be noticed which will go to confirm
the fact, and one is an enlargement of the neck. Singular
as this may appear, it is true: and some married ladies
keep the exact measure of their necks so as to be able to
detect this sign. Pains similar to colic, fainting fits, shuddering
and creeping of the skin, longings for unusual food
and drinks, loss of appetite, morning sickness, fretfulness
and peevishness, hysteria, and a dozen other changes in
the feelings, temper or desires of a woman, are strong presumptive
signs of conception.</p>

<p>The breasts, being always in sympathy with the womb,
usually begin to enlarge a little, the nipples become hard,
and their color turns from the usual delicate pink to a
chestnut brown, with little dots or pimples on the circle.
This alteration in the nipple must be closely observed to
indicate positive pregnancy, as it frequently becomes dark
from other causes. The hue occasioned by conception is
peculiar to itself, and is a sure indication that gestation has
commenced.</p>

<p>Soon after conception, in some females, the face and eyelids
will swell; and many girls are suspected from this
cause alone by their more experienced sisters. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
are warned of their condition by flying pains, palpitations,
&amp;c., and by pains at the top of the head. If the urine be
kept in a clean vessel for several days, and a white scum
arises at the top, this is considered by some physicians as
conclusive evidence of pregnancy.</p>

<p>When a woman has become pregnant, the white line
on the abdomen, extending from the navel to the pubis,
becomes darker, and the navel itself swells out a little.
The mucus membrane which lines the Vagina, which is
usually of a delicate rose color, turns blue or purple.</p>

<p>The above are the most prominent and conclusive evidences
of conception during the first three months, though
some of them may not be experienced until a later period.
At the end of thirteen weeks the enlargement of the
womb begins to develop itself so as to leave no doubt
whatever of the interesting situation of the lady. In some
cases even this enlargement is the result of other causes;
and should a doubt exist, an examination by a physician,
or any experienced person who can feel the mouth of the
womb with a finger, will determine the state of the case.
The mouth closes and contracts together immediately after
conception, and this condition of it can be easily detected
if the finger be applied in the right place. If the mouth
of the womb is not closed, then the enlargement is surely
from other causes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LABOR_AND_CHILD-BIRTH">LABOR AND CHILD-BIRTH.</h2>

<p>A healthy and natural birth usually takes place after
the fifteenth day of the ninth month of pregnancy. It may
be delayed until the end of the month, but is seldom so
protracted. Shortly before labor is to commence, the belly
sinks, and the hitherto snug-fitting dress will become loose.
This is caused by the descent of the womb into the bottom
of the belly. The motions and weight of the child are
also felt to be lower than usual, and if in a natural position,
the head will fall down to the orifice of the womb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and press upon it. This drives forward the membranes
which restrain the water at the orifice, and at the proper
moment they break, and labor then commences.</p>

<p>Labor is caused by involuntary contractions of the uterus
and abdominal muscles. By their force the liquor
amnii flows out, the head of the fœtus is engaged in the
pelvis, it goes through it, and soon passes out by the valve,
the folds of which disappear. These different phenomena
take place in succession, and continue a certain time: they
are accompanied with pains more or less severe, with
swelling and softening of the soft parts of the pelvis and
external genital parts, and with an abundant mucous secretion
in the cavity of the vagina. All these circumstances,
each in its own way, favor the passage of the fœtus.</p>

<p>The precursory signs of labor are as follows: Two or
three days before it is to commence, a flow of mucus takes
place from the vagina, and the external genital parts swell
and become softer: it is the same with the ligaments that
unite the bones of the pelvis; the mouth of the womb
flattens, its opening is enlarged, its edges become thinner,
and slight pains, known under the name of <i>flying pains</i>,
are felt in the loins and abdomen. At the next stage pains
begin to be felt in the lower part of the back, or lumbar
region, and tend towards the womb, or the rectum: these
occur at intervals of fifteen to thirty minutes, and each is
accompanied with contraction of the womb, and tension
of its neck, which begins to open. If a finger is now introduced
into the vagina, a considerable tumor may be
felt, which is a protrusion of the membrane coverings of
the fœtus, containing the first waters. The pains gradually
become stronger up to the time when the membranes break,
and labor actually begins.</p>

<p>The uterus now contracts on itself, and is applied to the
surface of the fœtus. Soon the pains and contractions of
the uterus increase considerably, and are accompanied by
the contraction of the abdominal muscles. The woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
should favor this state of things by making all the muscular
efforts in her power, (straining.) As the labor progresses,
her pulse will become stronger and more frequent;
her face becomes animated; her eyes grow brighter; her
whole body is in extreme agitation; perspiration flows in
abundance; until the head of the child descends into the
lower strait of the pelvis.</p>

<p>At this stage there is a discharge of whitish matter from
the vagina, and pains occur which extend from the small
of the back, or loins, and the groins, down towards the
front, or private parts; and sometimes the membranes will
even protrude through the external opening. Presently a
strong pain comes on, crack go the membranes, the liquor
amnii gushes out with a rush, deluging the bed. After
this there are longer intervals between the pains, and on
the midwife’s introducing her finger, she can feel the head
of the child. As the pains increase in intensity, the patient
is apt to scream, though some women of firmness
will suppress their feelings: she lays hold of a towel,
which is commonly fastened to the bed-post for this purpose,
and bears down with all her might: her pulse now is
rapid, and her skin is hot; the process still goes bravely
on; the pains are now more frequent, stronger and lasting.</p>

<p>The head of the child now gradually descends lower
and lower in the vagina until it presses on the perinœum,
or outer edge of the private part adjoining the anus. In
this stage of the labor an inexperienced midwife would
think that a few pains more would expel the child, but
although the head rests upon the perinœum, and shows
itself at the external orifice, yet it may be some hours before
it is expelled, more especially if it is a first child; but
if the second or third, half-a-dozen more pains will generally
be sufficient to complete the process.</p>

<p>During this time the woman usually suffers some from
head-ache, looks intensely red in the face, and often experiences
a trembling of the lower limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The outer passage will now begin to enlarge gradually,
and the head appears. When it is advanced as far as its
ears, it is said to be “in the passage.” When the birth
has advanced one-third, the midwife may assist the expulsion
if she chooses, though Nature alone would accomplish
it. When the child is born, the midwife should lay it upon
her knees, with its face down, so as to give exit to the
mucus, waters, &amp;c., from the mouth, if any has been imbibed,
which is most generally the case.</p>

<p>Now that the child is born, there is a freedom from pain
and the mother feels rejoiced at the sudden transition from
severe suffering to comparative ease. In about ten minutes
she again begins to experience pains, which are, however,
slight, or less violent than before, in the region of the uterus,
coming and going about every five minutes. On examination,
the accoucheuse will find a quantity of clotted
blood expelled, and on passing up the finger along the
cord, she will discover the after-birth, or placenta, as it is
called, forced into the upper part of the vagina. If not
attached to the womb, which is easily known by carefully
pulling at the cord, the midwife will separate it gently, by
introducing her hand. The navel-string must be divided
as soon as the child is born; which may be done with a
pair of scissors, having first tied a string as well on the
child’s side of the cord as the mother’s, to prevent hemorrhage.
The placenta being taken away, the labor is now
over.</p>

<p>An hour after, let the mother take a little oil of sweet
almonds, to ease the after pains; and let a poultice of oil
of sweet almonds, and two or three new-laid eggs, be boiled
together, and laid to the parts, renewing at every six
hours for two days. Fifteen days after the birth, the parts
may be bathed with an astringent decoction of red roses,
alum, or nut-galls in red wine, in order to brace them.
The following is the formula I usually employ: Red-rose-leaves,
1 ounce; Alum, 2 drams; Ordinary Claret, half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pint. Put them into a sauce-pan and let them boil for five
or ten minutes. After having stood for fifteen or twenty
minutes to cool, strain, and apply warm to the parts.</p>

<p>The above is a brief description of a healthy delivery;
and such are the usual ones. In some cases, however, the
labor may be tedious and difficult, when the lower part of
the belly must be covered with a flannel cloth dipped in a
hot decoction of bitter herbs, as tanzy, hops, wormwood
and catnep, of each a small handful, to which put three
pints of equal parts vinegar and water; boil for half an
hour in a covered vessel. Wring the flannel out and apply
warm over the region of the womb, which will relieve the
tension and ease the pain, besides gently stimulating the
uterus to contract more forcibly on its contents, whereby
the labor is facilitated.</p>

<p>Stimulating injections by the bowels, may now and then
be administered—especially if the woman be at all costive.
The midwife should also push back with her longest finger
the os coxygis, which tends to excite the labor and ease
the pain. If the parts are in a stiff, straitened condition,
as in the first child, especially if the woman is not young,
emollient liniments are to be used, and the parts must be
anointed with fresh butter or oil, and to be dilated gently
with the hand. If there is a tumor, carbuncle, or membrane
opposing the birth, the assistance of an experienced
surgeon is required.</p>

<p>Always in difficult labors, the patient should be made as
cheerful as possible by her friends, by the recital of lively
and amusing anecdotes, and by every species of encouragement
in their power; as a depressed and melancholy state
of mind invariably retards the labor.</p>

<p>Women in labor, who have a languid circulation and a
weak constitution, are benefited by cordials and good nourishment.
Let half a glass of wine be given every two
hours, which will invigorate the system, and render the
action of the uterus more powerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>If the feet present first, the midwife must be very cautious
lest there be twins, and lest she should take a foot of
each. The feet must be wrapped in a dry napkin, and the
child must be drawn gently, till the waist is in the orifice
of the uterus. Then the infant’s hands must be drawn
down close to the sides; and if the nose be turned towards
the pubic bone in front, it should be placed in an opposite
direction to prevent any obstacle. If the chin is embarrassed,
the midwife must disengage it, by putting her finger
into the mouth, in order to turn to advantage. In case the
infant’s head presents across the passage, or laterally, it
must be gently thrust back, and carefully turned to its
natural situation. If the shoulder presents, the same <i>tact</i>
and talent must be employed, although the difficulty is
greater. If the belly, hip, or thigh appears first, the child
must be extricated by gentle traction made at the feet, and
the mother must lie flat on her back. If one or both hands
are directed upward, above the head, and lie close to it, the
case is not so bad as some would apprehend; for they will
keep the orifice equally dilated till the head passes, and
thus prevent strangling.</p>

<p>When the fœtus dies before the time of birth, and the
membranes are not yet ruptured, it will not putrefy; therefore
the work must be left to Nature, for the pains of labor
will at length come on spontaneously. Baudelocque says,
if the navel-cord first appears, and is compressed soon after
by the head of the infant, its life is in danger; and the
remedy is to return the infant, and reduce the cord, till the
head fills the opening. But if this cannot be done, the woman
must be put in a suitable posture, and the child must
be extracted by the feet.</p>

<p>When the <i>placenta</i> first presents itself, which is known
by its spongy, soft texture, and the great quantity of blood
flowing at the same time, it requires speedy assistance.
If the membranes are entire, they should be broken, the
placenta and membranes should be returned into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
uterus, and the child be extracted by the feet (which is
more readily effected in the membranes than in the uterus),
and put into a proper situation. When there is a great
flow of blood from untoward accidents, the infant should
be immediately delivered by art, though the mother be not
in true labor.</p>

<p>I would caution all how they use the instruments when
the mouth of the womb is not fully opened, and never to
resort to them unless actually compelled to do so by some
serious danger which is to be apprehended from delay.
Many cases of this kind do occur, it is true, in large cities,
if one happens to have a large practice in this branch of
the Healing Art.</p>

<h2 id="ABORTIONS_AND_MISCARRIAGES">ABORTIONS AND MISCARRIAGES.</h2>

<p>The anxiety of a woman who desires to avoid pregnancy
will often lead her to such dangerous extremes that
she is ready to risk health, and even life itself, rather than
become a mother. Hence she earnestly seeks the means
to destroy her unborn child. When this is done so early
that the fœtus cannot live, it is called an abortion. After
the sixth or seventh month, it is a miscarriage. Abortions
are always dangerous, though some females get over them
without much suffering or harm. The most propitious
periods for an abortion are at three, five, and six months.
Both abortions and miscarriages are brought about by
irregularities of conduct, such as too eager gratification of
sexual desires, remaining too long in a warm bath, lacing
the corsets too tight, violent exercise, such as dancing,
riding a hard trotting horse, romping, jumping long distances,
&amp;c. Any of these imprudences will be apt to kill
the fœtus, which will soon thereafter be expelled from the
womb. Women know the moment the fœtus dies, for it
falls to the bottom of the abdomen and lies there a dead
weight, feeling like a foreign substance in the body.</p>

<p>Sudden and unexpected violence, such as falling down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stairs, or being knocked down unexpectedly, will produce
abortion or miscarriage, but as these mishaps would be a
severe shock to the nervous system, they endanger the life
of the mother. Any unnatural efforts to produce abortion,
such as forcing the mouth of the womb, or taking powerful
medicines, are also dangerous, as these may cause flooding
that cannot be stopped. Bleeding too freely will bring
on an abortion in some women, and on others will have
no effect.</p>

<p>Ergot of Rye is sometimes given by physicians to produce
abortion in the early stages of gestation. It is the
diseased seeds of the common rye, called grown rye. It
acts specifically on the uterus, or womb, increasing its contractile
energy. Ergot is not only a powerful promoter of
abortions and miscarriages, but it is given to women as a
stimulant to uterine action during labor, and also to check
hemorrhage. The dose, in powder, is fifteen to twenty
grains repeated every twenty minutes until the desired
effect is produced, or until one dram is taken. Or, a dram
of ergot may be infused in four fluid ounces of boiling water,
and one-third taken as a dose, and the other two doses
(if necessary) at intervals of twenty minutes. On some
women it will produce not only abortion at three or five
months, but even a miscarriage, particularly when the
fœtus is male. There is no doubt that many women can
escape child-bearing by the use of ergot, but it would be
better for any one to get it from her family physician, who
would know something of her constitution, than to pay a
hundred times its worth to a quack, and perhaps endanger
life or health by taking more than is prudent, and at an
improper time. Oil of Tansey is another article used to
bring on the monthly turn, and in some cases it will stop
the course of gestation if taken at the time the turn is due.
Two or three drops only are necessary for a dose. In some
women, a considerable dose will cause a miscarriage at
three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Abortions are sometimes produced under the direction
of physicians by inserting a small hand up into the Vagina,
and feeling for the mouth of the Womb with the finger.
A little extract of Belladonna is used to promote the relaxation
of its mouth, and by the most gentle means possible
the finger may force a passage, when flooding at once ensues,
and the fœtus will generally be expelled soon after.
Women who submit to this operation run some risk of
losing their lives, and hence a physician will seldom endanger
his reputation by advising it, except in extreme
perilous cases.</p>

<p>Abortions and Miscarriages being in collision with Nature’s
laws, should never be resorted to except in extreme
cases, and then only under medical advice.</p>

<h2 id="APHRODISIACS_OR_LOVE_POWDERS">APHRODISIACS, OR LOVE POWDERS.</h2>

<p>Many quack doctors advertise medicines to stimulate
the procreative powers, and thus create a desire for sexual
intercourse. These are sold at enormous prices, and are
often useless, for the reason that the venders of them cannot
know anything at all of their patients, and must fix
the dose so as to suit the most delicate temperament for
fear of injurious effects. The drugs used for this purpose
are sold by every apothecary, and indeed at almost any
country store. We will mention some of them:</p>

<p><i>Cannabis Indica</i> is the principal article used in making
love powders. It acts powerfully on the nerves, excites
the sexual organs, and increases their activity. The quantity
to be taken differs with different persons—too large a
dose producing extraordinary excitement and sexual desire,
which is followed by corresponding prostration, both
mental and physical. The proper use of this drug is not
detrimental to health.</p>

<p><i>Phosphorus</i> is another article used in making preparations
to excite the sexual organs. It has a disagreeable
smell, and must necessarily be disguised as much as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
It is powerful in its effects, and has frequently been
known to excite women so furiously as to make them discard
all prudence and abandon themselves to licentious
indulgence. Phosphorated Oil of Almonds, flavored with
bergamot, can be introduced into almost any gelatinous
substance to disguise the taste of the phosphorus. Dose,
from five to ten drops of the oil.</p>

<p><i>Ether</i> will affect some females very curiously, making
them amorous and imparting a strong desire to cohabit
with their husbands. On some, again, it has no such effect
at all. The dose of Nitrous Ether is from ten to forty
drops; or if you prefer Sweet Spirits of Nitre, take half a
fluid dram up to twelve drams.</p>

<p><i>Strong Coffee</i> is a direct stimulant of the generative organs,
and if taken in large quantities does not fail to produce
marked effects.</p>

<p><i>Ergot of Rye</i> is taken by some women to bring on their
expected monthly turn when they fear they may have become
pregnant. It acts as a stimulant and an invigorater
of the sexual powers. Dose, in powder, fifteen to twenty
grains.</p>

<p><i>Saltpetre</i> acts also as a stimulant to the sexual organs,
and causes a desire to cohabit. It is taken in daily doses
of five to ten grains, in the form of purified Nitrate of
Potassa.</p>

<p><i>Cantharides</i>, or Spanish Flies, is a direct stimulant of the
sexual feeling in some people. It is taken as a tincture, in
doses of ten to twenty drops, and should be used with
great caution.</p>
